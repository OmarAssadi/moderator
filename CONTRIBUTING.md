# Contributing guidelines

General guidelines when contributing.

## CONTRIBUTORS WANTED: LOOK INSIDE

Thanks for considering helping out with the project. Any contribution
of any size is masively appreciated!

## Versioning

When bumping the version number, please use SemVer-style versioning (Major, Minor, Patch).

See https://semver.org for more details.

## Branching

We use gitflow-style branches. What this means is that all changes should eventually end up on ```develop/```
and master should be reserved as a stable branch.

When making larger features, ideally, you should branch from ```develop/``` onto ```feature/cool-new-feature```.

To make your life easier, installing [gitflow-avh](https://github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow-avh) would probably
make the most sense. However, it is not necessary.
