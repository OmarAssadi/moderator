## License

Moderator is licensed under the EUPL v1.2.
You can find a rough TL;DR over at [Choose a License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/eupl-1.2/).

Note that nothing in or linked from this README should be considered legal advice.
Instead, please read [the license itself](/LICENSE.txt).

Essentially, the license is very similar to the AGPLâ€”meaning should you ever distribute this add-on,
all changes must be open-sourced (network/server usage is considered distribution). However, unlike
the AGPL, the EUPL is not an infectious license. And, as such, you are free to make you private, closed-source
extensions and plugins.
